Project includes, as Git sumodules, all needed Django applications;
only requirements are Python (2.5 or higher, but may work on earlier
versions of Python) and stable release of Django (1.0.2 at this
moment).

When some of dependencies are installed system-wide (especially if
installed with easy_install), Django may issue warnings similar to
one pasted below:

    Installing index for admin.LogEntry model
    Installing index for subscription.Transaction model
    /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/simplejson-2.0.9-py2.5-macosx-10.5-i386.egg/simplejson/_speedups.py:3:
    UserWarning: Module registration was already imported from /Users/admin/Projects/django-saas-kit/site-python/registration/__init__.py, but /opt/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django_registration-0.7-py2.5.egg is being added to sys.path
     import sys, pkg_resources, imp

Such warnings are not important, since they only indicate that
system-wide installation of django-registration is not used, and
project-local checkout is used instead.
